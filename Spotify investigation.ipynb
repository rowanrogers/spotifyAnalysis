    "# Spotify tunes\n",
    "A little look at the data that spotify provides via it's developer API suite. I have called the API to fetch the last 20 songs i listened to and then for each song have fetched the characteristics of that song including metrics calculated by spotify used for recommendations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The metrics include:\n",
    "- acousticness\n",
    "- danceability\n",
    "- energy (intensity and activity scale 0-1)\n",
    "- instumentalness (values over 0.5 imply instrumental, closer to 1 the more likely)\n",
    "- liveness (over 0.8 = strong likelihood that track is live recording)\n",
    "- loudness (in dB)\n",
    "- mode (1 if major, 0 if minor)\n",
    "- speechiness (presence of spoken word)\n",
    "- tempo\n",
    "- time_signature (3 - 7)\n",
    "- valence (positiveness)\n",
    "\n",
    "Twenty songs is not a large data set, so this will be an initial analysis of the metrics and how appropriate they seem given the song and to calculate the similarity between songs."
